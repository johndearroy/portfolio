In my seven years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I love working with a team. I've also had the opportunity to serve as the software engineer lead for three years with a lot of tech enthusist peoples.\n\nMy commitment to critical thinking and attention to detail have gotten me to where I am today as a senior software engineer. I have a passion for processes, and I'm an experienced team leader who typically manages 10 developers at any given time.\n\n“Prior to my senior role, I worked as a software engineer as well as a full stack developer for web and mobile. Because I've already held all the other positions in this field, I have keen insight into what it takes to run a successful project. My career goal is to move into management as a CTO, and I know this role would help me hone my leadership skills.”",
