# Portfolio of Dear Roy
I’m a web developer and designer living in Uttara, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I spend my days with my hands in many different areas of web development from back end programming (PHP, MySQL, Node, Laravel) to front end engineering (HTML5, CSS3, jQuery/Javascript, Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS, Anguler 6 etc), digital accessibility, user experience and visual design. 

I’m extremely passionate about web development and design in all it’s forms and helping small businesses and artisans build and improve their online presence. Aside from web development, I enjoy spending my time with my family, traveling and photography, reading books and learning new technologies.
